# Project title
Reliable Air Travel; Stratified Analysis of Flight Delay

# Short summary of the topic and background

Air travel is an important part of global transport, but it faces ongoing challenges around both environmental impact and service reliability. The aviation industry is under pressure to lower its carbon emissions while also ensuring that flights run on time. These two goals are often difficult to achieve together, as efforts to reduce emissions can sometimes affect operational performance, and vice versa.
This project, “Reliable Air Travel; Stratified Analysis of Flight Delay,” aims to explore how sustainability and reliability interact within the air travel industry. The study will look at the main factors that influence delays in domestic flights within the United States and how these vary between different routes. It will also test how well machine learning models can predict flight delays using operational and environmental data, and how these predictions may differ across routes and airlines.

 # Research Question
RQ1: What are the key factors influencing departure and arrival delays in domestic U.S. flights, and how do these vary by airline and airport?

RQ2: To what extent do machine learning models predict flight arrival delays based on operational and environmental features, and how do these predictions differ across airlines and routes?

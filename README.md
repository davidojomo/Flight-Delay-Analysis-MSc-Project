# Project title
Reliable Air Travel; Stratified Analysis of Flight Delay

# Aims and Objectives of the Study

The aim of the study is to analyse the operational, temporal and spatial factors influencing flight departure delays through an example dataset from U.S. aviation and evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning methods in predicting the departure delays. The study also evaluates the role of airlines and airports in predicting delays to take more nuanced precautions by flight operators. The study further examines how class imbalance affects model performance. 

**Objectives of the study:** 
- To develop and compare multiple machine learning models including Random Forest, LightGBM, XGBoost and Logistic regression to predict departure delays.
- To identify the most influential factors affecting flight departure delays using SHAP values.
- To assess the effect of imbalanced data on predictive performance and the role of class weighting techniques to improve performance of minority class recall.
- To conduct stratified analysis by airline and airport hub type to understand variations in delay drivers and model performance across operational contexts. 
 

 # Research Question
RQ1: What are the key factors influencing departure delays in domestic U.S. flights, and how do these vary by airline and airport?

RQ2: To what extent do machine learning models predict flight delays based on operational and geographic features, and how do these predictions differ across airlines and routes?

RQ3: What is the effect of imbalanced data on model bias toward the majority class in flight delay prediction, and how do resampling or class-weighting techniques improve minority-class recall?

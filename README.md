# Project title
Sustainable and Reliable Air Travel; A Two-Dimensional Analysis of Flight Emissions and Punctuality

# Short summary of the topic and background

Air travel is an important part of global transport, but it faces ongoing challenges around both environmental impact and service reliability. The aviation industry is under pressure to lower its carbon emissions while also ensuring that flights run on time. These two goals are often difficult to achieve together, as efforts to reduce emissions can sometimes affect operational performance, and vice versa.
This project, “Sustainable and Reliable Air Travel: A Two-Dimensional Analysis of Flight Emissions and Punctuality,” aims to explore how sustainability and reliability interact within the air travel industry. The study will look at the main factors that influence delays in domestic flights within the United States and how these vary between different routes. It will also test how well machine learning models can predict flight delays using operational and environmental data, and how these predictions may differ across routes and airlines.
In addition, the research will compare carbon dioxide emissions from international and domestic flights across countries to understand countries and regions influence emissions levels. Overall, the project aims to provide insights into how the aviation industry can improve both its environmental performance and its punctuality, helping to move toward more sustainable and dependable air travel.
 
# Research Question
RQ1: What are the key factors influencing departure and arrival delays in domestic U.S. flights, and how do these vary by airline and airport?

RQ2: To what extent do machine learning models predict flight arrival delays based on operational and environmental features, and how do these predictions differ across airlines and routes?

RQ3: How do CO2 emissions from international flights differ from domestic flights across countries?
